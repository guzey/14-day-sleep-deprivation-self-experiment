## SAT

All tests and all answer sheets are available in .xlsx format in *tests* folder. I downloaded all tests from this page: https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/full-length-practice-tests. At the time of the experiment, tests 2 and 4 are omitted from the page.

I took practice test 1 as practice 1 day before the experiment.

I took SAT practice tests 3, 8, 9 as controls and tests 5, 6, 7 as experimental condition.
