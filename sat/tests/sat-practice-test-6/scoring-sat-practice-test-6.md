math: 18 math 1 + 36 math 2 = 54 correct. According to *raw score conversion table 1* this is **790**.
reading and writing: 48 reading + 42 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 36 reading test score and 38 writing test score, which turns into (36+38)*10=**740**

So for SAT practice test 6 I got **790** math and **740** reading and writing.
