math: 18 math 1 + 34 math 2 = 52 correct. According to *raw score conversion table 1* this is **750**.
reading and writing: 46 reading + 35 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 36 reading test score and 33 writing test score, which turns into (36+33)*10=**690**

So for SAT practice test 9 I got **750** math and **690** reading and writing.
