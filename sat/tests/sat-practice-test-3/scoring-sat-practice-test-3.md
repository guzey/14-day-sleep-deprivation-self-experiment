math: 12 math 1 + 37 math 2 = 49 correct. According to *raw Score conversion table 1* this is **710**.
reading and writing: 51 reading + 40 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 40 reading test score and 36 writing test score, which turns into (40+36)*10=**760**

So for SAT practice test 3 I got **710** math and **760** reading and writing.
