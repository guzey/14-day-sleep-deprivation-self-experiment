math: 18 math 1 + 35 math 2 = 53 correct. According to *raw score conversion table 1* this is **780**.
reading and writing: 51 reading + 41 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 39 reading test score and 37 writing test score, which turns into (39+37)*10=**760**

So for SAT practice test 8 I got **780** math and **760** reading and writing.
