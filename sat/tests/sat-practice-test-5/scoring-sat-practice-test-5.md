math: 19 math 1 + 34 math 2 = 53 correct. According to *raw Score conversion table 1* this is **730**.
reading and writing: 49 reading + 38 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 37 reading test score and 35 writing test score, which turns into (37+35)*10=**720**

So for SAT practice test 3 I got **730** math and **720** reading and writing.
