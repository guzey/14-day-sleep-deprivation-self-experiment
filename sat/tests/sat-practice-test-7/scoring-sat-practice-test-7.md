math: 19 math 1 + 38 math 2 = 52 correct. According to *raw score conversion table 1* this is **790**.
reading and writing: 46 reading + 43 writing. According to *conversion equation 1* this translates into 36 reading test score and 39 writing test score, which turns into (36+39)*10=**750**

So for SAT practice test 9 I got **790** math and **750** reading and writing.
